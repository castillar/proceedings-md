## Ballot Contents ##

The following ballot is proposed by Dean Coclin of DigiCert and has been endorsed by Robin Alden (Sectigo) and Mike Reilly (Microsoft).

### Purpose ###

This ballot modifies the CSCWG charter to correct an error in the original document in Section 4.2.2.  It was pointed out that there is an error in the CSCWG charter, section 4.2.2 where it states:

> Applicants that qualify as Certificate Issuers or Root Certificate Issuers must supply the following additional information:
>
> * URL of the current qualifying audit report.
> * The URL of at least one third party website that includes a certificate issued by the Applicant in the certificate chain.
> * Links or references to issued end-entity certificates that demonstrate them being treated as valid by a Certificate Consumer Member.

The second bullet should be removed as it was a copy and paste error from another charter.

### Ballot Conflicts ###

None
