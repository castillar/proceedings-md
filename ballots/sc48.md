*This requirement was MET for Certificate Issuers and MET for Certificate Consumers.*
   * at least one Certificate Issuer and one Certificate Consumer Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted.\
*This requirement was MET.*
2. Bylaw 2.3(g) requires that a ballot result only be considered valid when “more than half of the number of currently active Members has participated”. Votes to abstain are counted in determining quorum. Half of the currently active members at the start of voting was 14, so the quorum was 15 for this ballot.\
*This requirement was MET.*

This ballot now enters the IP Rights Review Period to permit members to review the ballot for relevant IP rights issues.
